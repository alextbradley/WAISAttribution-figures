Note that in order to run these script, processed ice sheet (WAVI) and ocean model (MITgcm) output must be downloaded from the Zenodo repository: https://zenodo.org/record/7900762#.ZFUykOzMLPa They should be stored in the ./data folder. Note that this Zenodo repository also contains data to produce figures 3 and 4, obtained by applying the processing scripts contained in './gendata' folder (see the Zenodo repository for details).
